"""A manager nudges the borrower of a loan that should already be back.

`POST /bookings/{code}/remind-return/` is the manual half of the return emails:
the daily command only speaks the day *before* a return, so whoever lent a drill
had no way to ask for it once the date had passed. What these tests pin is when
the action exists (an overdue loan, and only the thing's **last** one), who may
press it, that it cannot be pressed twice in a day, and what the borrower is
sent — and that `/owner-bookings/` says all of it per row without a query per row.
