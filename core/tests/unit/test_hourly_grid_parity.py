"""The server's half of the hourly-grid parity table.

The request page offers hourly starts (`freeStartTimes`, and greys out a day
with `isHourlyPickupDisabled`, in `frontend/src/utils/rental.js`); the server
accepts them (`Collection.reservation_hour_violation`, `BookingPeriod.
has_overlap`) and reports whether a day has room (`_day_has_a_free_hour`, which
feeds the "available" line on every card). Tested apart, the two could drift and
both suites stay green: a member offered a start the server refuses, or a card
saying "today" for a day the picker greys out.

So the cases live in one JSON file, read here and by
`frontend/src/utils/hourlyGridParity.test.js`, each with its expected starts
worked out by hand. Here, every start on a five-minute sweep of the day is put
to the server, and the ones it accepts must be exactly those. No case's slot
spans a whole day across a gap: the server still accepts that one full-day form
the page stopped offering (2026-09), so it is the one place they differ on
purpose.
