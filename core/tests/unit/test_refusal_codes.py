"""The coded refusals a request can meet, and the promise their codes make.

``core`` has no gettext catalogue, so every refusal the API sends is an English
sentence — and the request page used to show it as-is to a Catalan or Spanish
member. A refusal now also carries a ``code`` (and the ``params`` its sentence
interpolates) that the SPA says in the reader's language, from
``requestErrors.<code>`` in ``frontend/src/i18n/locales``.

A code with no string there silently falls back to English again, which is the
failure this whole change exists to remove — so the last test reads the codes
straight out of the source and fails if one has no translation.
