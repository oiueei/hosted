"""
The two data-portability exports — and everything they must never carry.

The positive half of this file is bookkeeping: the tree has the keys it claims,
and ``_manifest.counts`` matches the database. The negative half is the reason
the module exists. An export is a file people email to themselves, forward to a
lawyer and leave on a laptop, so each of these is a real incident rehearsed:

- a ``share_token`` in the bytes is somebody's group handed over with the file;
- an ``RSVP.token`` is somebody's account;
- a co-member's email from a group you merely joined is a leak of a roster that
  was never yours;
- a member's postal code out of a PROPRIETARY group is the guests page's
  COMMUNITY gate quietly bypassed;
- a report against your things is the anonymity the whole feature promises.

Most are asserted against the **raw bytes**, not the tree: a refactor that moves
a value to a new key still fails them.
