"""
Management command to delete orphaned images from object storage (#9).

An "orphan" is an image that was uploaded (a ticketed direct-to-bucket upload
from a form) but whose form was never submitted, so no DB row ever referenced
its key. Deleting on record-delete — and, since 2026-10-02, on a save that
replaces or removes a key — is handled by ``core.services.asset_cleanup``; this
command catches the *other* leak — uploads that never became a record at all,
and anything that changed a row without going through ``save()``.

**Dry-run is the default.** It only lists what it *would* delete; pass
``--commit`` to actually delete. Safe to run on Heroku:

    # dry-run
    heroku run --app <app> "python manage.py cleanup_orphan_images"
    # delete — the bucket must be named, and must be the configured one
    heroku run --app <app> "python manage.py cleanup_orphan_images --bucket <bucket> --commit"

(Quote the inner command so the Heroku CLI doesn't eat ``--commit``.)

Safety rails:
- **Names its target.** ``--commit`` refuses to run unless ``--bucket`` names
  the very bucket this deployment has configured (``OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET``),
  and a ``--bucket`` that does not match is refused even on a dry-run — so a
  ``.env`` pointing at another deployment's storage is a refusal, never a
  deletion from that deployment's bucket.
- **Only lists the upload folders** (``storage.ASSET_FOLDERS``: things,
  collections, users, documents — the folders a ticketed upload may write to).
  Scanning the whole ``oiueei/`` tree treated everything unreferenced as an
  orphan, and the production dry-run of 2026-09-28 duly listed
  ``oiueei/assets/Curiosa-Variable.woff2`` — the variable font the Heroku
  build downloads in ``heroku-postbuild`` (not in git, licence): deleting it
  would have broken every deploy after it. Any other prefix — ``assets/`` and
  whatever comes next — is out by construction, not by an exception list, and
  a ``--prefix`` that does not fall inside an upload folder is refused with a
  ``CommandError`` before anything is listed.
- Cross-references **every** DB asset field — Thing.thumbnail + Thing.gallery,
  User.photo, Collection.thumbnail and Collection.welcome_doc, the one table in
  ``asset_cleanup.ASSET_FIELDS`` — so anything in use is kept. The welcome PDF
  matters here: it is an object in the same tree as the photos, so it turns up
  in this sweep like any of them, and a missing cross-reference would delete a
  live document. Welcome docs live in ``oiueei/documents/``, one of the
  upload folders, so they are swept alongside every other folder and
  cross-referenced the same way.
- Never touches the ``oiueei/seed/`` folder (the demo's shared image pool) —
  structurally now, since the seed folder is not an upload folder and is never
  listed; the explicit prefix check stays as a second lock.
- Only considers assets **older than --min-age-hours** (default 24h) so an
  in-flight upload mid-form isn't mistaken for an orphan, and **younger than
  --max-age-days** (default 30) so it stays a recent-window sweep. Run it
  regularly (e.g. weekly) and every orphan is caught within its window.

The age comes from S3's ``LastModified``, which for these objects is the upload
time: a key is random, written once and never rewritten, so nothing else can
move it. That is the property the window relies on, and the reason an object
must never be overwritten in place — doing so would reset its clock and hide it
from the sweep for another day.

**On checksums**, because this is the command that would break first: botocore
1.36 began sending ``x-amz-checksum-crc32`` by default and dropping
``Content-MD5``, and several S3-compatible providers reject it on
``DeleteObjects`` specifically. Verified accepted on Hetzner with botocore
1.43.78. If a future bump makes deletion start failing here, the rescue is in
``core/services/storage.py``, not in this file.
