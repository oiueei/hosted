"""
Enforce the retention periods (GDPR art. 5.1.e).

"How long do you keep this?" used to have one honest answer here — "forever" —
and that is not a valid one. This command is the other half of a decision taken
on paper first: a period per category of data, with a reason. It does not
invent any of them; every period is a setting (``RETENTION_*`` in
``config/settings/base.py``), and **0 means keep indefinitely** for a deployment
under a different regime.

**Dry-run is the default**, like ``cleanup_orphan_images``: this deletes real
rows, so it is meant to be looked at before it is trusted. Pass ``--commit``.

    python manage.py purge_expired_data            # count what would go
    python manage.py purge_expired_data --commit   # actually do it

Idempotent: every step selects only rows that are still in the "before" state,
so running it twice in a row does nothing the second time, and a run that dies
half way can simply be run again.

Two shapes of expiry, and the difference is the whole point:

- **Anonymised** — ``Event``. What expires is the link to a person
  (``actor_code``), not the fact that something happened. The series survives as
  aggregate and stops being personal data, which is what art. 5.1.e asks for;
  deleting it would throw away the history to achieve the same thing.
- **Deleted** — the guest accounts nobody ever answered for, ``DailyActivity``,
  ``InAppNotification``, ``Report``. There is no version of these that stops
  being about somebody.

        stranger's email in the database indefinitely. That address came from a
        third party (art. 14) and was used for exactly one thing: sending an

        - in no collection's ``invites`` — the membership M2M is written on
          **accept**, not on invite, so a row here is somebody who did answer
          and simply hasn't been back. Sweeping them would remove a real member
          from a real group.
        - owns no collection and no thing — content means a person, whatever the
          activity column says.
        - has no live ``COLLECTION_INVITE`` RSVP — their invitation is still
          open and may yet be accepted. **Not** "an expired RSVP": ``cleanup_rsvps``
          runs daily and deletes those, so by the time this looks there is no
          expired row to find. Absence is what expiry looks like from here, and

        Owning a group other people use does **not** skip the warning: that

        their account is not going anywhere (see the retention table). The
