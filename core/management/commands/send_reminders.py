Management command to send daily reminder emails.

Sends reminders for:
- Booking returns due tomorrow (end_date = tomorrow) — to **both** sides: the
  team that runs the thing (`Thing.managers()`: its owner and, in a PROPRIETARY
  collection, every curator — the people the request went to), who are
  expecting it back, and the borrower, who has to carry it there. Only the
  owner used to be told, which left the one person with something to do
  hearing nothing. RESERVE_THING is excluded here — nothing is
  carried anywhere. A single-day loan (start_date == end_date, tomorrow) is
  excluded too: its "return" reminder is the pickup one, the same day said
  twice.
- On-site reservations starting tomorrow (start_date = tomorrow) — to the
  member who booked the slot. A reservation can be booked up to a year out and
  auto-confirms, so nothing reaches the member between the confirmation and the
  day; a no-show costs a real slot.
- Lend/rent pickups starting tomorrow (start_date = tomorrow, LEND/RENT) — to
  **both** sides again: the borrower, who has to be somewhere at a time
  (`send_pickup_due_email`), and the team that runs the thing, who have to have
  it ready (`send_pickup_reminder_email`). The only pickup email before this was the
  acceptance, sent when the dates were agreed — weeks can pass before the day.
  RESERVE has its own arrival reminder above; GIFT/SELL have no dates.

The borrower's emails name the thing's owner by their bare ``name`` (the
sender says "a member" when there is none): ``display_name`` falls back to the
address, and the borrower never holds the owner's. The team's emails may name
the borrower by ``display_name`` — whoever manages the thing already reads the
requester's address on "Requests to me".

Run daily via Heroku Scheduler.
