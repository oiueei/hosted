    Carries the HTTP status the view should return so the request handlers can
    live in this service layer without importing DRF. The view translates it to
    ``Response({"error": message}, status=status_code)`` — preserving the exact
    response shape the API had when these handlers lived on ``ThingRequestView``.

    ``code`` is an optional machine-readable marker, added on top of that shape
    rather than replacing it — most callers still get a bare ``{"error": ...}``.
    It exists so a client can act on *which* rule failed without pattern-matching
    English prose (or worse, any 403 at all): ``RequestThingPage``'s auto-join
    checks for ``code == "not_a_member"`` specifically, so a *different* 403 on
    this endpoint — e.g. the thing going INACTIVE out from under an open form —
    can't be mistaken for a membership gap and silently join the reader to a
    group over an unrelated error.

    A rule refusal from the model (``core.utils.Refusal``) brings its own
    ``code`` and ``params`` along, so ``raise BookingRequestError(violation)``
    carries them without restating them. ``as_body()`` is the response body:
    ``{"error": ...}`` plus ``code``/``params`` when there are any — what lets
    the request page say the refusal in the reader's language rather than the

    returns a ``(available_today, next_available)`` tuple:

    - ``available_today`` (bool): True when *today* is free for a fresh pickup.
    - ``next_available`` (date | None): the earliest day a pickup could start on
      or after today, or None when no day within ``horizon_days`` qualifies.

    Range semantics match ``BookingPeriod.has_overlap()``'s strict overlap: a
    booking ``[s, e]`` blocks pickup on ``[s, e)`` but **not** on its return day
    ``e`` — that day is free for the next pickup (back-to-back handovers). So a

    lengths in days) and ``closed_dates`` (an iterable of ``date`` objects —
    ``Collection.closed_date_set()``, the collection's holidays/closures) are the

    — the same half-open day range every other date-based check uses. A
    whole-day booking (``start_time`` NULL — a LEND/RENT or a DAY-unit RESERVE

    one — this function was never told the minimum had become configurable.
