"""Delete a record's stored assets when the record is deleted, or when a save drops one.

Wired as ``post_delete`` signal handlers on Thing, Collection and User (see
``core.apps.CoreConfig.ready``) so it covers direct deletes, the collection
view's orphan-thing sweep, and user-account cascades alike — anywhere a row
actually disappears. The destroy runs on ``transaction.on_commit`` (a
rolled-back delete keeps its images) and never raises: an orphaned asset is a
smaller problem than a delete that blows up.

**A save that replaces or removes a key destroys the old object too**
(2026-10-02). Until then only a delete did: a removed profile photo, a swapped
cover, a photo taken out of a thing's gallery or a replaced welcome PDF stayed
in the bucket, unreachable, until somebody ran ``cleanup_orphan_images`` by
hand inside its 30-day window — and past that window, for good. That broke the
``/legal`` promise that a photo goes when you remove it. ``post_init`` notes
the keys a row was loaded with and ``post_save`` destroys the ones the save
dropped, on commit, under the same rules as a delete.

Keys under ``storage.SEED_PREFIX`` are **never** destroyed. The demo's fixtures
are a shared pool: every database that has ever seeded points at the same
objects, so deleting one demo row — from the admin, from a cascade, from
anywhere — must not take an image away from every other environment. This used
to be handled only by ``seed_demo --reset`` suspending the whole mechanism,
which left the admin as an open trapdoor; the skip below closes it, and
``suspended()`` stays for what it is actually for.

**A key another row still holds is never destroyed either** (2026-10-02). A
row does not own its keys: a key is the path of its public URL, and
``ImageIdField`` binds it to a folder, not to an uploader. So a member who
could see someone else's photo could save its key on a thing of their own and
delete that thing — and this handler deleted the other person's photo with it.
The check runs at destroy time, after the commit, so the row being deleted no
longer counts.
