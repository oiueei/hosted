"""The collection calendar export — date-based reservations as iCalendar (.ics).

A curator downloads their collection's upcoming loans, rentals and on-site
reservations as an RFC 5545 VCALENDAR. A whole-day booking (every LEND/RENT,
and a DAY-unit RESERVE) is **one all-day event covering the days the thing is
unavailable** — from the pickup day up to (not including) the return day, since
the return day is already free for the next booking. A one-week loan picked up
Monday blocks Mon–Sun and leaves the next Monday open. An **HOUR-unit
RESERVE_THING** (`booking.start_time` set) is instead one *timed* event,
rendered in UTC so the file needs no VTIMEZONE and imports at the same wall
clock everywhere.

**Why .ics and not the CSV this used to be.** Google Calendar's CSV importer
reads dates in the format of the *importing account* — an early adopter's
day/month account read ``10/01/2026`` as the 10th of January (the earlier
"verified" import was against a US-locale
account, so the MM/DD/YYYY assumption was never true in general). iCalendar's
dates are unambiguous and carry their timezone, and Google, Apple Calendar and
Outlook all import them — on a phone, opening the file is enough.

**Every upcoming reservation, not just the new ones.** Each VEVENT's UID is
``{booking.code}@oiueei``, stable across downloads, so a calendar that
re-imports the file updates its events in place instead of duplicating them —
which is what made the old incremental watermark unnecessary. The
``CalendarExportMark`` model (and its lock) is therefore **dormant**: this
module neither reads nor writes it, the row stays in the schema for the
release after this one, and it is dropped then (the two-release rule
``reservation_max_hours`` followed).

**A cancelled reservation travels too, marked as cancelled.** A calendar that
imported a reservation keeps it after the member (or a curator) cancels it —
the file is a copy, not a subscription. So every download also carries each
upcoming reservation that was cancelled, under the same UID, with
``STATUS:CANCELLED`` and ``SEQUENCE:1`` (live events are ``SEQUENCE:0``): RFC
5545 has a calendar accept a revision only when its SEQUENCE is higher than
the copy it holds, and one that honours the status then drops or strikes out
its copy. Only RESERVE_THING can get here — it is the one verb that goes from
ACCEPTED to CANCELLED; a loan or rental is only ever cancelled while PENDING,
so it never reached a calendar in the first place. How an importing app treats
a cancellation it receives by file differs from app to app; the file says what
the standard lets it say.

**Why this file needs no "people outside the group" filter, unlike the group
copy** (``export_service.build_collection_export``, which has one). It carries
accepted reservations only (and cancelled RESERVE_THINGs). An accepted LEND or
RENT is already in the thing's journey: ``accept_booking`` writes the
``ThingTransfer``, and ``ThingTransferView`` shows it, name included, to anyone
signed in who can see the thing — so the calendar tells a COMMUNITY organiser
nothing the thing's own page does not. RESERVE_THING lives only in PROPRIETARY
collections, where the curators run every thing anyway. A security review took
this for a leak on 2026-09-29 and proved it was not one; the pending, refused
and cancelled requests that *do* stay private never reach an ``.ics``.

Everything user-written that reaches a TEXT property — a thing headline, a
member name, a project note — is escaped per RFC 5545 §3.3.11 (backslash,
semicolon, comma, newline), which replaces the spreadsheet-formula guard the
CSV needed. Owner headlines that carry one text per language (inline JSON)
resolve to the collection's language.
