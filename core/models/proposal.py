    Members could not bring anyone in at all: every new person cost an owner
    action, so the only growth path ran through one person per group. But an
    owner is not just a bottleneck to route around — the group may be closed, may
    require a subscription, papers, or rules of admission we know nothing about.
    So a member proposes and **the owner decides**, and nothing reaches the
    proposed address until they do.

    The order matters: no `User` row is created and no email is sent to the
    proposed address on proposal. Somebody being suggested must not learn they
    were suggested if the answer turns out to be no.

    Approval reuses the ordinary invitation path, so an approved proposal is
    indistinguishable from an owner's own invite — including counting against the
    **owner's** `INVITE_EMAILS_PER_DAY` quota, since it leaves their group under
    their sending domain.
