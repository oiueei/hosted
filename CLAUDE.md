# OIUEEI - Development Guide

## Repositories and branches

OIUEEI ships as **two public repos from one working copy**:

- **`oiueei/standalone`** — the product, everything a self-hoster gets. Branches
  `development` (work here) and `main`, both pushing to `origin`. `core/` only;
  `frontend/src/deployment/` exports empty stubs; `CREATOR_POLICY` defaults to
  `OpenCreatorPolicy` (no gate).
- **`oiueei/hosted`** — the www.oiueei.com service layer (branch `hosted` →
  `hosted/main`). It only ever **adds**: the `hosted/` Django app (open sign-up
  door, creator vetting, weekly operator report), the real
  `frontend/src/deployment/` pages, the operator's `/legal` identity, Sentry.
  `core/` never imports from `hosted/`. See `SELF_HOSTING.md` (the extension
  points) and `hosted/README.md` (what this deployment did with them).

**Flow:** `development` → merge into `main` → merge `main` into `hosted` →
pushing `hosted` to `oiueei/hosted:main` **is the deploy** — Heroku is
GitHub-connected with auto-deploy + wait-for-checks, so a red CI holds the
previous release and there is no `git push` to a dyno.

**A product fix always starts on `development`**, even when a hosted-only
scenario surfaced it: commit on `development`, merge to `main` and `hosted`,
*then* it reaches production. A `core/` change committed straight on `hosted` is
invisible to the sync and has to be re-applied by hand forever
(`hosted/README.md` §"Where a fix belongs"). **Verify the current branch before
editing** — legal text (`frontend/src/legal/`) and deployment settings diverge,
and the working copy may be left on any of the three branches.

## Project Conventions

- **Single Django app**: all product code lives in `core/` (the `hosted` branch adds one service-layer app, `hosted/` — see Repositories and branches above)
- **Settings**: Split into `base.py`, `development.py`, `production.py` under `config/settings/`
- **Code style**: Ruff (100-char lines) — `ruff check` (lint + import sort) and `ruff format`; replaces black/isort/flake8. Pre-commit hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (run `pre-commit install`).
- **Test structure**: `core/tests/unit/`, `core/tests/integration/`, `core/tests/scenarios/`. One fixture is **shared with the frontend**: `frontend/src/test/hourlyGridParity.json` holds the hourly-reservation cases both `core/tests/unit/test_hourly_grid_parity.py` and `frontend/src/utils/hourlyGridParity.test.js` read, so the starts the request page offers and the ones the server accepts cannot drift apart. Moving or renaming it breaks a suite on each side; new cases go in the file, not in either test.
- **Coverage minimum**: backend **96%**, frontend **88/82/81/90** (statements/branches/functions/lines), both enforced by CI. The frontend numbers live in `frontend/vite.config.js` (`test.coverage.thresholds`), which is the one that CI actually enforces — raise them there and here in the same commit. They are **ratchets, not targets** — each sits ~2 points under the suite's real coverage so a genuine regression is visible. Raise them as coverage grows; never lower one to make a red build pass. New code owes tests that name a behaviour, not lines.
- **All PKs**: 6-character alphanumeric codes generated via `secrets.choice()` (not auto-increment)
- **Dependencies are pinned, not ranged**: `requirements/*.txt` uses `==` on every direct dependency, so the `pip-audit` run in CI and the Heroku build resolve the same versions — a range let a release published between them reach production unaudited. Transitives are still unpinned; a full `pip-compile --generate-hashes` lock has to be resolved on Python 3.12 (`.python-version`), not on whatever is local. CI audits **both** `production.txt` and `development.txt`. Frontend: `npm ci` + `package-lock.json` already give this, gated by `frontend/scripts/audit-gate.mjs`.
- **Emails**: All user content escaped via `django.utils.html.escape()`
- **String length in migrations**: SQLite (local) does NOT enforce `CharField(max_length=N)` at the DB level — PostgreSQL (Heroku/production, **and CI**) does. Since the 2026-08 testing round CI runs the backend suite on Postgres (`DATABASE_URL` in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`), so an overflow now fails a build instead of reaching production — but a local `pytest` still won't see it. Always verify that seed data fits within the model's `max_length` before committing. Key limits: `headline` = 64, `description` = 2000 per language (Thing/Collection `description` are now `TextField` — long-form Markdown — with a per-language visible cap the serializer enforces, `LOCALIZED_DESCRIPTION_*` in `core/validators.py`; no column width to overflow), `name` = 32, `email` = 64, `question` = 64, `answer` = 256, `location` = 64 (widened from 32 for RESERVE addresses), `about` (User Markdown bio) = 2000, each `tags` label (Collection/Thing) = 32 (max 12 tags), `deposit_policy` (Collection) = 256 / 1024 stored (still `CharField`), `request_info` (Collection, the request-page note for every verb) = 512 / 2048 stored (CA's call, 2026-09: 256 was too short), `email_note` (Collection, the owner's note in the requester's emails) = 512 / 2048, `BookingPeriod.project_note` (RESERVE only) = 512. `Thing.type` column = 16. `Collection.reservation_max_days` (1–7) / `reservation_horizon_days` (1–365, default 90) / `reservation_max_active_per_member` (1–50, default 10) — RESERVE collections only. `Collection.reservation_unit` (DAY/HOUR) / `opening_hours` (JSON, HOUR only) / `reservation_min_minutes` / `reservation_max_minutes` (1–720 each, defaults 60/180, HOUR only, minutes — replaced hour-granular `reservation_max_hours` in migration 0150; the maximum applies to the full-day span too, no exception; `reservation_max_hours` left the model in 0152, its column kept with a database default of 3 until a later release drops it — dropping it in the same release would break the previous release's dynos, which still name it in every query, while the release phase runs). `Collection.home_page` = 128 (`URLField`, serializer-capped too).
- **Owner content can be multilingual**: on **Thing and Collection**, `headline`, `description` and each `tags` label may hold one text per language as inline JSON — `{"es": "Las cosas de mamá", "ca": "Les coses de mama"}` — and every reader sees theirs (`core.utils.parse_localized` / `resolve_localized`, `frontend/src/utils/localized.js`). Anything that isn't a strict `{lang: text}` map over `es`/`ca`/`en` renders **verbatim**, so an owner writing prose never notices. Consequently the limits above are **per language**: Thing/Collection `headline` = 64 visible / 256 stored, `description` = 2000 visible (a `TextField` — no column cap; the serializer's `storage_max_length` 6400 is only a sanity bound), tag label = 32 / 160 (JSONField), Collection `deposit_policy` = 256 / 1024, `request_info` = 512 / 2048 (CA's call, 2026-09), `email_note` = 512 / 2048. The serializer (`LocalizedHeadlineField` / `LocalizedTextField`) is what enforces the visible limit — the column no longer does (and for `description` there is no column limit at all). `Report.thing_headline` snapshots `Thing.headline`, so it tracks its width.
- **Demo data lives in a command, not migrations**: `python manage.py seed_demo` populates Lala/Lele/Lili/Lolo/Lulu and their collections. Idempotent (`update_or_create`). Fresh DBs start empty; run the command explicitly (also on Heroku: `heroku run --app <app> "python manage.py seed_demo"` — quote the inner command, otherwise the Heroku CLI intercepts inner flags like `--lang`/`--reset` as its own). Collection/thing text is always seeded in **all three languages at once** (inline `{es,ca,en}` localized maps, tag labels and `Collection.deposit_policy` included — the constants in `seed_data/common.py`); `--lang=en|es|ca` only picks the language of the plain-column text (user bios, FAQs), and `--reset` wipes demos before re-seeding. The shared structure lives in `seed_data/common.py` and each language's text in `seed_data/{lang}.py`, merged by `seed_demo.load_seed_data` (parity + length limits pinned by `core/tests/unit/test_seed_localized.py`). Don't add new demo data to migrations — edit the relevant `seed_data/*.py` and re-run. To add a new language, copy `en.py` → `{lang}.py` and translate only the text (keep the same codes/keys — the structure stays in `common.py`, respecting model max_length), then add the code to `SUPPORTED_LANGS` in `seed_demo.py`.

## Model selection

- **Session default: `opusplan`** (`~/.claude/settings.json`). Opus reasons in plan
  mode, Sonnet executes.
- **A code review runs on Opus, never Sonnet** — whether it is asked for in the
  chat or run through `/prerelease`. A review is judgement, not typing, and the
  session default puts Sonnet on everything that is not plan mode.
  - `/prerelease` pins it itself: `model: opus` in its SKILL.md frontmatter, which
    overrides the session model for the turn that invokes it and is not saved to
    settings. Verified against the official skills frontmatter schema, which
    accepts the same values as `/model`.
  - The **bundled** `/code-review` cannot be pinned this way: its frontmatter is
    not ours, `skillOverrides` controls visibility only, and shadowing the name
    with a local skill would replace the review itself rather than its model. Set
    the session model to Opus before invoking it.

## Commit attribution

Claude Code's own trailer is switched off (`"attribution": {"commit": ""}` in
`~/.claude/settings.json`), so the trailer below is the only one a commit carries.
There is exactly one format:

```
AI-assistant: Claude Code (<model name and version>)
```

- **The model name comes from the live model**, read from whichever model is actually
  running: `Claude Opus 5`, `Claude Sonnet 5`, `GLM-5.3`. Never copied from a
  constant, a config file, or a previous commit — when a new version ships, the
  line must reflect it on its own.
- **The tool is always named**, whoever built the model: the line says what wrote
  the code, and through what. A different assistant names itself in that slot.
- **The parentheses hold the model name and version and nothing else** — not the
  subject of the commit, a summary of the task, a date, a branch name, an issue id,
  or a context-window marker. A second value is added by asking, not by inventing.
- **No email address.** The old format carried one and it was pure syntax: a model
  is not an author and holds no copyright, so no mailbox belongs to it. Inventing
  one is what produced the `opus5@anthropic.com` errors of August 2026.
- **Not `Co-Authored-By:`, deliberately** (changed 2026-09-27). Git, GitHub and DCO
  practice all read that trailer as *another author with standing*, and this
  codebase's licensing rests on all copyright sitting in one pair of hands
  (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the CLA that closes before launch). A model cannot be a
  co-author, so claiming it in the one field a reader checks was the wrong claim in
  the most sensitive place. `AI-assistant:` says what actually happened and leaves
  `Co-Authored-By:` for people.
- **Exactly one `AI-assistant:` line — never two on the same commit.** A commit
  names the model that actually produced *that commit's* changes. Under `opusplan`
  that is almost always Sonnet, since Opus only reasons in plan mode and writes
  nothing to the tree itself; name Opus instead only when Opus's own output, not
  just its plan, is what landed in that diff. If two models' work truly can't be
  told apart within one commit, that is a sign the commit should have been split by
  concern — not a reason to stack trailers.
- **Never copy a trailer from git history.** The body's style is worth imitating;
  the trailers are not. Every commit up to and including `6dbf8e2` (2026-09-22)
  carries the old `Co-Authored-By:` format, and the history is **not** being
  rewritten — so `git log` has two eras and the older one is not a precedent.
  Inside it, the commits of August 2026 are wrong even for their own era (a task
  descriptor in the parenthesis, invented addresses, and some stacking two trailers
  on one change); those were left in place deliberately too.

Valid — one trailer per commit:

```
AI-assistant: Claude Code (Claude Sonnet 5)
```

```
AI-assistant: Claude Code (Claude Opus 5)
```

```
AI-assistant: Claude Code (GLM-5.3)
```

Invalid — two models stacked on one commit, even when both genuinely took part:

```
AI-assistant: Claude Code (Claude Opus 5)
AI-assistant: Claude Code (Claude Sonnet 5)
```

When in doubt about how to compose the line, ask rather than decide.
