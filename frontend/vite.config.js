    // Tree-shaking is **not** an outstanding win here, though this comment used
    // to say it was. Measured at the 2026-08 pre-release frontend review by
    // grepping the built chunk for the marker strings of components we never
    // import — CookieConsent, Header, Footer, Search, Stepper, Pagination,
    // SideNavigation, PhoneInput, PasswordInput, Breadcrumb, Card, Tabs, Hero,
    // Logo — and none of them is in it. What is left is the ~30 components,
    // their shared internals and the 24 icons this app really renders. Switching
    // the imports to `hds-react/components/*` subpaths would buy nothing, and
    // the icons have no subpath export to switch to.
    //
    // The number is a tripwire, not a budget: it sits just above the current
    // chunk so the next HDS minor that grows it materially says so out loud.
    // Raise it deliberately, after checking the gzipped figure — that is the
    // one that governs the 4G mid-range Android target in DESIGN §7. Bumped
