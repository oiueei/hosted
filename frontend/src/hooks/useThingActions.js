/**
 * Owner-button-matrix + reservation view-model shared by ThingPage and
 * ThingLinkbox. Wraps {@link useThingBooking} (the calendar fetch + async
 * handlers) and adds the derived flags and the button label/disabled logic both
 * views computed identically inline.
 *
 * The genuine card-vs-page and member-vs-anonymous differences are passed as
 * options so the returned view-model is a faithful superset of what each view
 * built before:
 *
 * - `isPaused`        — collection is paused (ThingLinkbox on a paused
 *                       collection; ThingPage passes false — no pause there).
 * - `canAct`          — the viewer may act (ThingPage passes `isAuthenticated`;
 *                       ThingLinkbox defaults true and uses `loginToAct` below).
 * - `loginToAct`      — anonymous-on-public mode: buttons show but each click
 *                       should route to the collection's `/join` page.
 * - `collectionOwner` — explicit collection owner code (ThingLinkbox prop);
 *                       falls back to `thing.collection_owner`.
 * - `onThingChange` / `setToast` / `initialActivePending` / `initialRequested`
 *   / `fetchOnEndless` / `activateSuccessMessage` / `collectionCode` — forwarded to
 *   {@link useThingBooking} (card vs page seeds differ).
 *
 * `bookingKeepsStatus` is derived here (`needsPage || is_endless`, identical in
 * both views) so callers don't repeat it.
 *
 * Returns everything {@link useThingBooking} returns, plus: `isOwner`,
 * `canManage`, `isCollectionOwner`, `isDateBased`, `needsPage`,
 * `canDelete`, `hasPendingBookings`, `showButton`, `isMine`, `buttonDisabled`,
 * `loginButtonDisabled`, `buttonLabel`.
 *
 * **`canManage`** is the backend's `thing.can_manage` — true for the owner, or
 * a curator of a PROPRIETARY collection the thing sits in, who runs its
 * catalogue and bookings the same as the founder (2026-09). The owner-button
 * matrix, the delete button and the "hide the reserve button from staff" guard
 * all key on it now, not on `isOwner`. `isOwner` is kept for the few genuinely
 * owner-only bits (the "transfer ownership?" confirm copy).
