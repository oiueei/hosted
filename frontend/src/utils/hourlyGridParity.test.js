/**
 * The request page and the server each decide which hourly starts exist: the
 * page offers them (`freeStartTimes`, `isHourlyPickupDisabled`), the server
 * accepts them (`Collection.reservation_hour_violation`, `has_overlap`,
 * `_day_has_a_free_hour`). Tested apart, each could drift from the other and
 * both suites stay green — a member offered a start the server refuses, or a
 * day greyed out that has room. These cases live in one JSON file that
 * `core/tests/unit/test_hourly_grid_parity.py` reads too, with the expected
 * starts worked out by hand in each case's note.
