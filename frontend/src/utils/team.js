/**
 * Who runs a collection, in the one order and with the one rule every place that
 * names them follows: the founder first, then the co-curators; those with a name
 * are named, those without are only counted — at the end.
 *
 * The API sends a person's bare `name`, never an email standing in for it (the
 * email is withheld from co-members, L2), so someone who set none arrives as
 * `''`. Listing them would leave a gap — "Oriol, ," — so they are counted
 * instead ("2 more people", `collectionPage.curatorsMore`), the founder
 * included. And with nobody named there is nothing to say at all.
 *
 * `CollectionPage`'s "Run by:" line (which links each name) and the "Run by"
 * column of "My groups" on the own profile (plain text) both read it, so the two
 * cannot come to disagree about who is on the team or how it is written
 * (CA, 2026-10-03).

 * The conjunction and the commas are the browser's own (`Intl.ListFormat`, in the

 * twice). With nobody named: `[]`.
 *
 * Each piece is `{ type: 'member', member }` (a name with its `code`, for the page
 * to link), `{ type: 'more', text }` (the count of those without a name) or
 * `{ type: 'literal', value }` (what the language puts between them). The hero
