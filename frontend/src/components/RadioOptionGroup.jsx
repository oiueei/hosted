/**
 * A generic dynamic radio group — one HDS `SelectionGroup` of `RadioButton`s
 * built from a caller-supplied option list. Extracted for `RequestThingPage`'s
 * HOUR-unit reservation flow (duration, then start time — two more dynamic
 * radio groups after `ReservationRulesFields`' static DAY/HOUR one), so all
 * three share one place that gets the two documented `SelectionGroup` quirks
 * right (frontend/CLAUDE.md) plus a third this codebase found the hard way:
 *
 * 1. Children must be one flat array, never a bare `.map()` result nested
 *    inside another expression — `SelectionGroup` doesn't flatten and the
 *    whole group silently renders with zero radios.
 * 2. Every child needs its own `id` (`SelectionGroup` re-wraps each in a
 *    `<div key={child.props.id}>`).
 * 3. That wrapper `id` must be DIFFERENT from the `RadioButton`'s own `id` —
 *    reusing it duplicates the id in the DOM, and `<label for>` then resolves
 *    to the empty wrapper, leaving every radio's accessible name blank. A
 *    bare radio-count assertion doesn't catch this; only a name-scoped query
 *    (`getByRole('radio', { name: … })`) does.
 *
 * `errorText` (optional) is passed to the `SelectionGroup`.
