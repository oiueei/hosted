/**
 * "Some of these need approval here" — the one line a narrowed deployment owes
 * the person looking at a shorter list than the product has.
 *
 * **Upstream it never renders.** OIUEEI's own policy withholds nothing, so
 * there is nothing to explain and this returns null on every page it sits on.
 * It lives here rather than in a deployment's own directory precisely so the
 * React is identical in both: a deployment narrows the policy on the server and
 * the explanation appears, with nobody editing a form component.
 *
 * Without it, the form silently offers less than the product does and the user
 * is left to conclude the feature does not exist — which for a deployment with
 * a request URL is not even true.
 *
 * **Where to ask is a primary button, "Request access"**, not a
 * link ending in an arrow: the sentence stays as it was, and under it a
 * `.button-row-wide` (the width of the screen on a phone) holds the button. It is
 * made as `FeedbackLink` is — HDS `Link` with `useButtonStyles`, the theeeme's
 * primary tokens, `target="_blank"` and the announcement of the new tab in the
 * `aria-label`, since HDS's own `openInNewTab` prints its label. Without a request
 * URL there is the sentence and no button, as before. **A deployment may send the request
 * to a page of the app instead** (`deployment/requestAccessPaths`, by withheld value): then
 * the button is a `ButtonLink` to that route — same tab, through the router, no new-tab
 * announcement — for the first withheld value (in the catalogue's order) that has one. These forms already have a
 * primary of their own ("Create" / "Save"); this one is wanted all the same.
 *
 * @param {'collection_modes'|'collection_kinds'|'thing_types'} kind Which capability list to check.
 * @param {Array<{value: string, label: string}>} catalogue Every option the
 *   product has, already labelled — the same list the form would offer if
 *   nothing were withheld.
