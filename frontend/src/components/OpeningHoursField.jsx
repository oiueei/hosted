/**
 * The weekly opening-hours editor for an HOUR-unit reservations collection:
 * one raw-JSON `TextArea`, matching `Collection.opening_hours` exactly —
 * `{"0".."6": [["HH:MM","HH:MM"], ...]}`, Python weekday() numbering
 * (0=Mon…6=Sun) as string keys, a day absent or given `[]` closed. CA's own
 * call, after trying the per-day block editor this replaced: typing or
 * pasting the JSON directly is faster than clicking through seven fieldsets
 * for a schedule you already have written down somewhere.
 *
 * Local `draft` mirrors `BoundedDayInput`'s pattern — the owner can type a
 * momentarily unbalanced brace without the field fighting them — but unlike
 * that field (and unlike `ClosedDatesField`, which forwards its raw string
 * untouched), this one *must* parse on the way out: `opening_hours` is a
 * nested JSON object in the request body, not a string, so an unparseable
 * draft simply cannot become a valid `onChange` call. A parse failure keeps
 * the parent's last-known-good value and shows an inline error instead of
 * ever forwarding one — the deeper *shape* checks (day keys, HH:MM format,
 * overlap) still stay the backend's job, same as everywhere else in these
 * forms (`_validate_opening_hours`, surfaced as its own 400 via Toast).
 *
 * **The re-sync compares content, not the `value` reference, and does it
 * during render — not in an effect.** `BoundedDayInput` can key its resync
 * effect on the bare reference because its `value` is a number — equal
 * content IS equal reference there. This field's `value` is an object, so a
 * parent that ever passes `openingHours={form.opening_hours || {}}` (a fresh
 * `{}` literal on every render whenever the field is unset) would fire an
 * effect keyed on `[value]` on every unrelated keystroke elsewhere in the
 * form and wipe whatever JSON the owner was mid-typing back to `{}` — real
 * data loss in a field people paste a whole week's schedule into. Both
 * current call sites happen to pass a referentially-stable `useState` object,
 * so this was never reachable in production, but the component's own
 * contract shouldn't have silently depended on that.
 *
 * `syncedJson` holds the content we last synced FROM `value` (starting at the
 * initial one, before any typing). This is React's own documented pattern for
 * "adjusting state when a prop changes" — https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#adjusting-some-state-when-a-prop-changes
 * — a plain `if` in the render body, not a `useEffect`: calling `setState`
 * conditionally inside an effect (which an earlier version of this fix did)
 * is itself the anti-pattern `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` flags, since it
 * commits the stale draft to the screen first and only corrects it a tick
 * later. Doing the comparison during render lets React re-render with the
 * synced draft before anything paints, and it terminates the same way: once
 * `draft`/`syncedJson` reflect `value`, the condition is false on the very
 * next render, so there is no loop. A re-sync also clears any error: the draft
 * it installs is the parent's own value, valid by construction.
 *
 * **`onValidityChange(valid)` tells the page whether the draft on screen is
 * one this field could hand over.** Keeping the last-known-good value is only
 * half of not losing work: the page's Save used to send that stale value and
 * navigate away, taking the inline error with it — so an owner whose paste had
 * a trailing comma believed a schedule was saved that never was (found in
 * review, 2026-09-18). The page refuses to submit while this reports `false`.
 * It mirrors `error` from an effect rather than being called from `commit`
 * alone, since the error also clears on a re-sync (during render, where a
 * parent's setter can't be called). The cleanup reports `true` on unmount: an
 * unmounted field has no draft on screen to refuse, and when it mounts again it
 * shows the last good value, which is what the parent holds. Collapsing the
 * "More options" accordion is **not** an unmount — HDS hides a closed
 * Accordion's content with `display: none` and keeps it mounted — so the
 * refusal outlives the owner folding the section away, which is the point
 * (`EditCollectionPage.test.jsx` pins that). Pass a stable function (a state
 * setter): the effect re-runs whenever its identity changes.
