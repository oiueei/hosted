/**
 * The colophon under every page (i14): "Made with ♥︎ in Zona Franca,
 * Barcelona…" after the doors below. From 768px it is **one line** — "What
 * OIUEEI is · Privacy & legal · Contact us · Made with ♥︎ in …" — and under 768px
 * the two lines it always was, the doors over the text (CA, 2026-10-03). Global (mounted once in App), painted with the viewer's theeeme
 * `color_02` — the same token every `.form-page` uses as its background — so
 * there is no colour seam under the page. It sits at the bottom of the visible
 * screen on a short page and after the content on a long one (G7, CA 2026-10-05:
 * `#root` is a column as tall as the viewport, `<main>` takes what is left). `useLocation()` re-renders it
 * on navigation, which re-reads the theeeme after a login/profile change (the
 * pages get this for free by remounting; a permanent component must ask).
 * The heart is U+2665 + U+FE0E (text presentation) so it inherits the text
 * colour instead of turning into a red emoji.
 *
 * **The links, added in the 2026-08 design round.** `/legal` is the page the
 * privacy claims tell you to go and check, and a deployment's "what is this?"
 * page answers the question a stranger asks first — yet every link to either
 * sat behind a login (Home's empty state) or on a page only a joiner sees
 * (LoginPage, a deployment's own doors). Someone reading a public collection,
 * which is the top of the whole funnel, could reach neither. They stay plain
 * text links: this is still a colophon, not the HDS `Footer` site-map OIUEEI
 * has no content for (DESIGN §3).
 *
 * **"Contact us" is the third door** (CA, 2026-10-04): it was a speech-bubble icon
 * in the corner of every hero ("too many icons up there"); it is `/contact` here,
 * on every page, in the reader's language — **or, where a deployment hosts a form of
 * its own for it (`deployment/externalForms.contact`, TL1, CA 2026-10-05), a plain
 * link to that form** in the reader's language, in a new tab and announced as one.
 * `/contact` and its page stay in the app either way (upstream uses them; elsewhere
 * they are reached only by typing the address). `/login` keeps its own "trouble signing
 * in?" line, which is a different link, in the content.
 *
 * **Aligned to the content column, not centred** (CA, 2026-10-04): the footer's own
 * background is the full width of the page, and `.site-footer-inner` inside it has
 * the column of the page (1248px, the same side padding as `.page-container`) with
 * `text-align: left`, so the first letter falls on the vertical of the headings and
 * the text above it. The first link loses its left padding for that.
 *
 * The about link is conditional because upstream there is no such page —
 * `/welcome` left with the demo, and what OIUEEI is gets told in the README.
 * A deployment that has one supplies it through `frontend/src/deployment/`.
 *
 * **The one line.** The `<nav>` keeps only the links (it is a landmark) and the
 * text stays outside it; between them is a separator `·`, `aria-hidden` like the
 * one between the links and spaced the same, that App.css shows only from 768px.
 * Below that it is `display: none`, because on two lines it would hang at the end
 * of the first one. Upstream, with no about link, the line is "Privacy & legal ·
 * Contact us · Made with ♥︎ in …".
