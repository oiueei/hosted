/**
 * The account's own pages, one click away from every hero: "My profile", "My requests", "Requests to me" and "Log
 * out", under "Home", used to live only on `/` and `/me` — hard to reach from
 * inside a collection, and **unreachable at all** from one whose owner set a
 * `home_page`, since that hero's own "Home" link leaves OIUEEI for the group's
 * own site.
 *
 * "Edit profile" and "Create collection" are not here: the first
 * is reached from "My profile", the second from Home. And "Requests to me" is
 * shown only to someone who can receive requests — owns a thing, or runs a
 * PROPRIETARY collection — which only the server knows, so the menu asks
 * `GET /auth/me/` (`receives_requests`) when it opens (`useReceivesRequests`,
 * shared with the collection menu). Nothing is kept in the browser for it (a new
 * storage key is one more line in the `/legal`), and while the answer is not there,
 * or if it cannot be had, the link is left out.
 *
 * **On a page that has a collection menu, "Requests to me" is that menu's first
 * entry, not this one's**: `requestsInCollectionMenu` says so,
 * and the menu then neither shows the link nor asks the server. That is a
 * collection's page and a thing's read through a collection, for whoever has the
 * collection menu there; everywhere else (Home, `/me`…) the link stays here — and
 * so it does for a reader who has no collection menu on such a page, so the link is
 * never in neither.
 *
 * **The link to the page on screen says so**: each is a `NavLink` with `end`, which
 * sets `aria-current="page"` on an exact match (`/me` is current on `/me`, not on
 * `/me/edit`).
 *
 * A plain navigation disclosure — a button that shows/hides a `<nav>` of
 * `Link`s — not an HDS `Select` dressed as a menu: every
 * option here is a **route**, not an action, and a `Select` announces itself
 * as a combobox to a screen reader (an accessibility risk). No `role="menu"` either — that role expects arrow-key
 * navigation between actions; this is `Tab`-navigable links, so the native
 * semantics already say what it is.
 *
 * Rendered first in the shared `.hero-corners` flex row (and, on `CollectionPage`,
 * followed by `CollectionMenu` and `ShareCollectionMenu`) — see `PageLayout` and
 * the manual-hero pages for where. The contact icon that used to close the row
 * went to the site footer on 2026-10-04 ("Contact us"): too many icons up here.
 * **Session-gated, not page-gated**: it reads `userCode` itself, so it needs no
 * prop from any of its many call sites.
 *
 * **Signed out, the same icon in the same place is a link to sign in**: not a panel but a plain `<Link>` to `/login` that comes back to the
 * page the reader is on (`loginPathFor(location)`), named "Sign in". It was nothing
 * at all, so a visitor with no session had no corner. Not on `/login` (it would
 * lead to itself), `/logout` or `/verify/…` and its aliases, where it still paints
 * nothing — `isDoorPath`, the same list a login never returns to. On a public
 * collection it used to sit beside the hero's own "Sign in" button; `CollectionPage`
 * now passes `offerSignIn={false}` there, since
 * the hero's button is the way in.
 * **`offerSignIn={false}` paints nothing signed out either**: a
 * door that does not want to send people to `/login` — a deployment's own
 * open door (`popInPath`), which drops "Already have an account?" on purpose — says so through
 * `MagicLinkJoinPage`'s `offerSignIn`, which `PageLayout` hands down. It changes
 * nothing for a signed-in reader, and where nobody passes it (`/share`, `/join`, the
 * 404…) the icon stays.
